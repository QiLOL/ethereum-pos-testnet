This is the core repository for Prysm, a [Golang](https://golang.org/) implementation of the [Ethereum Consensus](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/) specification, developed by [Prysmatic Labs](https://prysmaticlabs.com). See the [Changelog](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/releases) for details of the latest releases and upcoming breaking changes.

### Getting Started

A detailed set of installation and usage instructions as well as breakdowns of each individual component are available in the [official documentation portal](https://agora-cl-docs.bosagora.org). If you still have questions, feel free to stop by our [Telegram](https://t.me/bosagora_eng).

### Staking on Mainnet

To participate in staking, you can use the [official Agora staking site](https://agora-staking.bosagora.org/). This site is the only recommended way to become a validator on mainnet. You can explore validator rewards/penalties via the consensus layer explorer: [agorascan](https://www.agorascan.io/), and follow the latest blocks added to the chain on [boascan](https://www.boascan.io/).
